<h2>2009-2010: Software Developer</h2>

<p>
  Ever since my school days, I had an undeniable love for reading, 
  writing and a deep fascination with computers. Following my high school, 
  I eagerly pursued a computer course and eventually completed my Master's 
  degree. It helped kickstart my career as a software developer.</p>
  
<p>A majority of my technical expertise was acquired on the job through 
  hands-on experience. My enthusiasm for technology and my fundamentals
  played a significant role in my ability to learn and adapt to 
  new concepts effortlessly.It also allowed me to analyze technical 
  issues and seek out the right solutions on time.

  problem-solving, and multitasking, shaping me into a 
  well-rounded professional.

<h2>2011-2012: Content Writer</h2>

<p>
  I took a career break for family reasons. Meanwhile, I decided to 
  leverage my love for writing. That's how I transitioned into the world 
  of content creation. This opened doors to exciting opportunities,
   introduced me to doing research, developing content, and implementing SEO strategies.
</p>

<p>
I started crafting informative content, ensuring its uniqueness and relevance.
This experience not only honed my writing skills but also instilled a 
profound understanding of diverse industries, their products, and services.
I gained expertise in optimizing content for SEO purposes, 
strategically placing keywords, and skillfully paraphrasing copy to meet 
specific word counts. 

The freedom to work as a freelancer while traveling allowed me to 
experience different cultures and expand my horizons.

<h2>2013-2014: Elementary, ICT Teacher</h2>

<p>
  As much as I enjoyed writing, I realized I was stuck with a monotonous 
  writing style! I saw no scope for advancement.
  I felt the need for personal and professional growth. I craved new 
  challenges, conversations, social interaction, and wanted to step out 
  of my comfort zone.
</p>

<p>
  With a Bachelor's degree in Education, I embraced the opportunity to 
  impart knowledge, communicate effectively, and lead with confidence. 
  I had the opportunity of teaching elementary graders in a new country 
  for a year. It was a proud and an enriching experience that enhanced 
  my adaptability and empathy.

  This remarkable journey of teaching not only refined my speaking and 
  leadership skills but also instilled within 
  me a profound sense of fulfillment.
